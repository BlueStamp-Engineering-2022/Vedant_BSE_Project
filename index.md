Facial Recognition Door Lock
The facial recognition door lock uses the faces of saved people to open a door lock. It can also greet guests, tell you who is at the door, save multiple guests, and more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. I added the SD card and camera to the raspberry pi and installed the OS as well to finish setting it up. After that I installed necesarry libraries and packages such as OpenCV and Boto3. After I finished a large part of setting up the AWS I moved on to hardware. I built the lock using the 3d printed parts, a servo, and an arduino. The arduino controls the servo which spins a gear and turns the lock.

# Starter Project 
My starter project was the TV-B-GONE. The components include IR LEDS, a microcontroller, button, batteries, transistors, and controllers for the LEDs. The device works when the IR LEDs are activated which sends out pulsing IR signals. TVs are programmed to detect certain patterns which tell them different commands. The TV B GONE just emits the IR patterns for power control which is what turns the TV off.
